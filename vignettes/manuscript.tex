\textbf{Abstract}\\Productivity of lentic ecosystems is well studied and
it is widely accepted that as nutrient inputs increase, productivity
increases and lakes transition from lower trophic state (e.g.,
oligotrophic) to higher trophic states (e.g., eutrophic). These broad
trophic state classifications are good predictors of ecosystem
condition, services (e.g., recreation and aesthetics), and disservices
(e.g., harmful algal blooms). While the relationship between nutrients
and trophic state provides reliable predictions, it requires \emph{in
situ} water quality data in order to parameterize the model. This limits
the application of these models to lakes with existing and, more
importantly, available water quality data. To address this, we take
advantage of the availability of a large national lakes water quality
database (i.e., the National Lakes Assessment), land use/land cover
data, lake morphometry data, other universally available data, and apply
data mining approaches to predict trophic state. Using these data and
random forests, we first model chlorophyll \emph{a}, then classify the
resultant predictions into trophic states. The full model estimates
chlorophyll \emph{a} with both \emph{in situ} and universally available
data. The mean squared error and adjusted R\textsuperscript{2} of this
model was 0.09 and 0.8, respectively. The second model uses universally
available GIS data only. The mean squared error was 0.22 and the
adjusted R\textsuperscript{2} was 0.48. The Kappa coefficient of the
trophic state classifications derived from the chlorophyll \emph{a}
predictions were 0.57 for the full model and 0.29 for the ``GIS only''
model. Random forests extend the usefulness of the class predictions by
providing prediction probabilities for each lake. This allows us to make
trophic state predictions and also indicate the level of uncertainty
around those predictions. For the full model, these predicted class
probabilities ranged from 0.42 to 1. For the GIS only model, they ranged
from 0.33 to 0.96. It is our conclusion that \emph{in situ} data are
required for better predictions, yet GIS and universally available data
provide trophic state predictions, with estimated uncertainty, that
still have the potential for a broad array of applications. The source

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Productivity in lentic systems is often categorized across a range of
trophic states (e.g., the trophic continuum) from early successional
(i.e., oligotrophic) to late successional lakes (i.e., hypereutrophic)
with lakes naturally occurring across this range (Carlson 1977).
Oligotrophic lakes occur in nutrient poor areas or have a more recent
geologic history, are often found in higher elevations, have clear
water, and are usually favored for drinking water or direct contact
recreation (e.g., swimming). Lakes with higher productivity (e.g.,
mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes) have greater nutrient loads, tend to be
less clear, have greater density of aquatic plants, and often support
more diverse and abundant fish communities. Higher primary productivity
is not necessarily a predictor of poor ecological condition as it is
natural for lakes to shift from lower to higher trophic states but this
is a slow process (Rodhe 1969). However, at the highest productivity
levels (hypereutrophic lakes) biological integrity is compromised
(Hasler 1969, Smith et al. 1999, Schindler and Vallentyne 2008).

Monitoring trophic state allows for rapid assessment of a lakes
biological productivity and identification of lakes with unusually high
productivity (e.g., hypereutrophic). These cases are indicative of lakes
under greater anthropogenic nutrient loads, also known as cultural
eutrophication, and are more likely to be at risk of fish kills, beach
fouling, and harmful algal blooms (Smith 1998, Smith et al. 1999, 2006).
Given the association between trophic state and many ecosystem services
and disservices, being able to accurately model trophic state could
provide a first cut at identifying lakes with the potential for harmful
algal blooms (i.e., from cyanobacteria) or other problems associated
with cultural eutrophication. This type of information could be used for
setting priorities for management and allow for more efficient use of
limited resources.

As trophic state and related indices can be best defined by a number of
\emph{in situ} water quality parameters (modeled or measured), most
models have used this information as predictors (Imboden and G{ä}chter
1978, Salas and Martino 1991, Carvalho et al. 2011, Milstead et al.
2013). This leads to accurate models, but these data are often sparse
and not always available, thus limiting the population of lakes for
which we can make predictions. A possible solution for this issue is to
build models that use widely available data that are correlated to many
of the \emph{in situ} variables. For instance, landscape metrics of
forests, agriculture, wetlands, and urban land in contributing
watersheds have all been shown to explain a significant proportion of
the variation (ranging from 50-86\%, depending on study) in nutrients in
receiving waters (Jones et al. 2001, 2004, Seilheimer et al. 2013).
Building on these previously identified associations might allow us to
use only landscape and other universally available data to build models.
Identifying predictors using this type of ubiquitous data would allow
for estimating trophic state in both monitored and unmonitored lakes.
Furthermore, being able to classify a large number of lakes would have
implications for the management of lakes. A broader discussion of
ecological classification and resource management is beyond the scope of
this paper, but see (Carpenter 1999) for more information on this topic.

Many published models of nutrients and trophic state in freshwater
systems are based on linear modelling methods such as standard least
squares regression or linear mixed models (Jones et al. 2001, 2004).
While these methods have proven to be reliable, they have limitations
(e.g., independence, distribution assumptions, and outlier sensitivity).
Using data mining approaches, such as random forests, avoids many of the
limitations, may reduce bias, and often provides better predictions
(Breiman 2001, Cutler et al. 2007, Peters et al. 2007, Fernández-Delgado
et al. 2014). For instance, random forests are non-parametric and thus
the data do not need to come from a specific distribution (e.g.,
Gaussian) and can contain collinear variables (Cutler et al. 2007).
Second, random forests work well with very large numbers of predictors
(Cutler et al. 2007). Lastly, random forests can deal with model
selection uncertainty as predictions are based upon a consensus of many
models and not just a single model selected with some measure of
goodness of fit.

The research presented here builds on past work in three areas. First,
we built, assessed, and compared two random forest models of chlorophyll
\emph{a} with 1) \emph{in situ} and universally available GIS data and
then 2) universally available GIS data only. Second, we converted the
chlorophyll \emph{a} estimates, for both models, to trophic state and
assessed prediction accuracy and uncertainty. Third, we examined the
important predictors for both models. Lastly, to promote transparency in
our work, the analysis code and data are available as an R package from
\url{https://github.com/USEPA/LakeTrophicModelling}.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Data and Study Area}\label{data-and-study-area}

We utilized three primary sources of data for this study, the National
Lakes Assessment (NLA), the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and lake
morphometery modeled from the NHDPlus and National Elevation Data Set
(Homer et al. 2004, USEPA 2009, Xian et al. 2009, Hollister and Milstead
2010, Hollister et al. 2011, Hollister 2014). All datasets are national
in extent and provide a unique snapshot view of the condition of lakes
in the conterminous United States during the summer of 2007.

The NLA dataset was collected during the summer of 2007 and the final
datasets were released in 2009 (USEPA 2009). With consistent methods and
metrics collected at over 1000 locations across the conterminous United
States (Figure \ref{fig:nlaMap}), the NLA provides a unique opportunity
to examine broad scale patterns in lake productivity. The NLA collected
data on biophysical measures of lake water quality and habitat as well
as an assessment of the phytoplankton community. For this analysis, we
only use the various water quality measurements from the National Lakes
Assessment (USEPA 2009). Additionally, the NLA included ecological
regions as defined in the Wadeable Streams Assessment (Figure
\ref{fig:ecoregion_map}) (Omernik 1987, USEPA 2006).

Adding to the monitoring data collected via the NLA, we used the 2006
NLCD data to examine landscape-level drivers of trophic status in lakes.
The NLCD is a national land use/land cover dataset that also provides
estimates of impervious surface. We calculated total proportion of each
NLCD land use land cover class and total percent impervious surface
within a 3 kilometer buffer surrounding each lake (Homer et al. 2004,
Xian et al. 2009). We chose this buffer distance for several reasons.
First, in some preliminary efforts we tried a variety of scales (300 m,
1.5 km, and 3 km), and they had little impact on prediction accuracy.
Second, since we also include local lake specific variables (see below)
as well as the broader scale ecoregions, we chose the 3km buffer as it
made intuitive sense as representative of land use impacts that would
not be accounted for these other variables. While many regional
classifications and scales have been shown to be effective (e.g.,
Cheruvelil et al. 2013), we chose a three kilometer buffer as it
represented an intermediate scale that is greater than immediate parcels
but smaller than regional and whole-basin measures.

Local, lake specific characteristics have been show to be important
(Read et al. 2015). Thus to account for this, we used measures of lake
morphometry (i.e., depth, volume, fetch, etc.). As these data are
difficult to obtain for large numbers of lakes over broad regions, we
used modeled estimates of lake morphometry (Hollister and Milstead 2010,
Hollister et al. 2011, Hollister 2014). These included: surface area,
shoreline length, Shoreline Development, Maximum Depth, Mean Depth, Lake
Volume, Maximum Lake Length, Mean Lake Width, Maximum Lake Width, and
Fetch.

\subsection{Predicting Trophic State with Random
Forests}\label{predicting-trophic-state-with-random-forests}

Random forest is a machine learning algorithm that aggregates numerous
decision trees in order to obtain a consensus prediction of the response
categories (Breiman 2001). Bootstrapped sample data are recursively
partitioned according to a given random subset of predictor variables
and a predetermined number of decision trees are developed. With each
new tree, the sample data subset is randomly selected and with each new
split, the subset of predictor variables are randomly selected. For a
more detail description of random forests see Breiman (2001) and Cutler
et al. (2007).

Random forests are able to handle numerous correlated variables without
a decrease in prediction accuracy; however, one possible shortcoming of
this approach is that the resulting model may be difficult to interpret,
thus selecting the most important variables is an important first step.
Several methods have been proposed to do this with random forest. For
instance, this is a problem often faced in gene selection and in that
field, a variable selection method based on random forest has been
successfully applied and implemented in the R Language as the
\texttt{varSelRF} package (D{í}az-Uriarte and De Andres 2006), but this
is limited to classification problems. Additionally, others have
suggested alternative variable importance measures, but this is only
needed with a large number of categorical variables which are selected
against with traditional random forest approach (Strobl et al. 2007).

In our case, we predicted a continuous variable, chlorophyll \emph{a},
directly thus \texttt{varSelRF}, does not apply, and nearly all of our
variables are continuous so the approach suggested by Strobl (2007) is
not necessary. Thus we developed an approach, similar to
\texttt{varSelRF} but applied to random forest with regression trees.
With this approach we fit a full random forest model that includes all
variables and a large number of trees. We then rank the variables using
the increase in mean square error, which has been shown to be a less
biased metric of importance than the mean decrease in the Gini
coefficient (Strobl et al. 2007). Using this ranking, we then iterate
through the variables and create a random forest with the top two
variables and record mean square error and adjusted R\textsuperscript{2}
of the resultant random forest. We then repeat this process by adding
the next most important variable in order of importance. With this
information we identify both the top variables and the point at which
adding variables does not improve the fit of the overall model. These
variables are selected and used as the ``reduced model.'' With this
method, a minimum set of variables that maximizes model accuracy is
provided. This allows us to start with a full suite of predictor
variables from which to select a minimum, easier to interpret set of
variables.

\subsection{Model Details}\label{model-details}

We used the \texttt{randomForest} package in R to build predictive
models of chlorophyll \emph{a} with two sets of predictors (Liaw and
Wiener 2002). The first included \emph{in situ} and universally
available GIS predictors. We refer to this as the ``All variables''
model. For the second model we used just the universally available data
(i.e., no \emph{in situ} information). This is referred to as the ``GIS
only'' model. A list of all considered variables is in Appendix 1. Our
separation of predictors was chosen so that we could highlight the
additional predictive performance provided by adding the \emph{in situ}
water quality variables on top of the GIS only variables. Lastly, we
used only complete cases (i.e., missing data were removed) so the total
number of observations varied among models.

Our modelling work flow was as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Identify a minimal set of variables from the full suite of variables
  (Appendix 1) that maximize accuracy of the random forest algorithm.
  This minimal set of variables, the reduced model, is calculated for
  each of the models.
\item
  Using R's \texttt{randomForest} package, we develop two random forest
  models with 5000 trees (``All variables'' and ``GIS only'').
\item
  Assess model performance for both the predicted chlorophyll \emph{a}
  and for categorical trophic state classifications. Trophic state was
  defined using the NLA chlorophyll \emph{a} trophic state cut offs
  (Table \ref{tab:trophicStateTable}).
\item
  Examine importance and partial dependence of the most important
  variables.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Measures of Model Performance and Variable
Importance}\label{measures-of-model-performance-and-variable-importance}

We assessed the performance of the random forest two ways. First we
compared the root mean square error and the adjusted
R\textsuperscript{2} of the models. Second, we examined the accuracy of
the model predictions when converted to trophic states classes via a
confusion matrix (Table \ref{tab:trophicStateTable}). A confusion matrix
shows agreement and disagreement in a tabular form with predicted values
forming the columns of the matrix and observed values, the rows. From
this tabulated information we calculated the total accuracy (i.e.,
percent correctly predicted) and the Kappa coefficient, which takes into
account the error expected by chance alone (i.e., the off diagonal
values of the matrix) (Cohen 1960, Hubert and Arabie 1985). The Kappa
coefficient can range from -1 to 1 with 0 equaling the agreement
expected by chance alone. Values greater than 0 represent agreement
greater than would be expected by chance. A Kappa coefficient greater
than approximately 0.6 is considered ``substantial'' agreement (Landis
and Koch 1977). Negative values are rare and would indicate no agreement
between the predicted and observed values. We use Kappa as a means of
comparison across models as well as within subsets of a given model.
Additionally, random forest builds each tree on bootstrapped, random
subsets of the original data, thus, a separate independent validation
dataset is not required and random forest error estimates are expected
to be unbiased (Breiman 2001).

Random forests explicitly measure variable importance with two metrics:
mean decrease in Gini and percent increase in mean squared error. These
measure the impact on the overall model when a particular variable is
included and thus can be used to assess importance (Breiman 2001). The
Gini Index has been shown to have a bias (Strobl et al. 2007), thus, we
used percent increase in mean squared error to assess variable
importance. Lastly, partial dependence plots provide a mechanism to
examine the partial relationship between individual variables and the
response variable (Jones and Linder 2015). We examined these plots for
the top variables as assigned by percent increase in mean squared error
for each the reduced models.

\subsection{Trophic State
Probabilities}\label{trophic-state-probabilities}

One of the powerful features of random forests is the ability to
aggregate a very large number of competing models or trees. Each tree
provides an independent prediction or vote for a possible outcome. In
the context of our chlorophyll \emph{a} models, we have 5,000 estimates
of chlorophyll \emph{a} for each lake. We convert these values to
trophic states (Table \ref {tab:trophicStateTable}) then count up total
votes for each class and divide by total possible votes to get an
estimate of the probability that a lake is in a given trophic state. For
instance, for a single lake (National Lake Assessment ID =
NLA06608-0005), the vote probabilities for the ``All variables'' model
were 95\% for oligotrophic, 5\% for mesotrophic, 0\% for eutrophic, and
0\% for hypereutrophic. The maximum probability provides the predicted
class, in this case oligotrophic, and suggests little uncertainty in
this prediction. We refer to this value as the ``prediction
probability.''

Further, we might expect higher total accuracy for lakes that have more
certain predictions. This should be evident by looking at the Kappa
coefficient of lakes given their prediction probability is at or above a
certain probability. To test this we use an approach similar to one
outlined by Paul and MacDonald (2005) and implemented by Hollister et
al. (2008) and examine the change in Kappa coefficient as a function of
the prediction probability for both models.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Our complete dataset included 1148 lakes; however 5 lakes did not have
chlorophyll \emph{a} data. Thus, the base dataset for our modelling was
conducted on data for 1143 lakes. The lakes were well distributed across
the four trophic state categories (Table \ref{tab:trophicStateTable})
and spatially throughout the United States (Figure \ref{fig:nlaMap}).

\subsection{Models: All Variables}\label{models-all-variables}

The model built with all predictors used 1080 total observations, had a
mean squared error of 0.09 and and R\textsuperscript{2} of 0.8. The
accuracy of the four trophic states was 68.7\% and the Kappa coefficient
was 0.57 (Table \ref{tab:Confusion_All_4}). The variable selection
process identified a reduced model with 20 variables (Figure
\ref{fig:all_varsel_figure}). The six most important variables were
turbidity, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, elevation, total organic
carbon, and N:P ratio (Figures \ref{fig:All_Importance}). The role that
each played in predicting chlorophyll \emph{a} varied (Figure
\ref{fig:all_partial_dependence}).

\subsection{Models: GIS Only Variables}\label{models-gis-only-variables}

The GIS only model was built using 1138 total observations, had a mean
squared error of 0.22 and and R\textsuperscript{2} 0.48. Four trophic
states were predicted with a total accuracy of 49\% and had a Kappa
coefficient of 0.29 (Table \ref{tab:Confusion_GIS_4}). The variable
selection process for this model produced a reduced model with 15
variables (Figure \ref{fig:gis_varsel_figure}). The six most important
variables were ecoregion, percent cropland, elevation, latitude, percent
evergreen forest, and mean lake depth (Figures \ref{fig:GIS_Importance}
\& \ref{fig:all_partial_dependence}).

\subsection{Trophic State
Probabilities}\label{trophic-state-probabilities-1}

The ``All variables'' model provides more certain model predictions with
a median prediction probability of 0.81 versus 0.72 for the ``GIS only''
model (Figure \ref{fig:prob_cdf}). Additionally, the Kappa coefficient
of the predictions is a function of this uncertainty. Lakes with more
certain predictions were more accurately classified and had higher Kappa
coefficients (Figure \ref{fig:cond_prob_fig}). For both models, when
prediction probabilities are approximately 0.8 or higher, the models had
a Kappa coefficient of \textasciitilde{}1. This represents 55\% of the
lakes for the ``All variables'' model and 22\% of the lakes for the
``GIS only'' model. A Kappa coefficient of 0.6 or higher is considered
``substantial'' agreement (Landis and Koch 1977). For the ``GIS only''
model this is seen with 52\% of the lakes. Lastly, as prediction
probabilities increased, the difference in Kappa coefficient between the
two models decreased (Figure \ref{fig:cond_prob_fig} \& Tables
\ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_all} \& \ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_gis} ).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsection{Trophic State
Probabilities}\label{trophic-state-probabilities-2}

Not surprisingly, lakes with more certain predictions (i.e., higher
prediction probabilities) were more accurately predicted (Figure
\ref{fig:cond_prob_fig}). The fact that the difference in accuracy (as
measured by the Kappa coefficient) between the two models decreased as
certainty in the prediction increased suggests that models with lower
overall accuracy, such as the ``GIS only'' model, may have acceptable
accuracy for many individual cases (Tables \ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_all}
\& \ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_gis}). Additionally, the prediction
probabilities may be mapped for each of the four classes (Figure
\ref{fig:gis_probability_map}). The spatial patterns show little
variability between the ``All variables'' and ``GIS only'' models, thus
we only show the results from the more broadly applicable ``GIS only''
model (Figure \ref{fig:gis_probability_map}).

This map provides several insights. First, since low uncertainty is
associated with high accuracy, this map shows the broad spatial patterns
of lake trophic state across the United States (i.e darker colors more
likely to be correctly predicted). Hypereutrophic lakes are much more
commonly predicted in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Clear,
oligotrophic lakes are in the northwestern United States, through the
western mountains and in the northeastern united states. The middle
trophic states are more evenly distributed across the country. Lastly,
this particular map is very similar to simply mapping the raw data.
However, it highlights what could be done if the ``GIS only'' model were
used to map data without measured chlorophyll \emph{a} values which
would provide probabilities of given trophic states for all lakes in the
United States.

\subsection{Partial dependencies of explanatory
variables}\label{partial-dependencies-of-explanatory-variables}

In line with past predictive modelling of chlorophyll \emph{a}
concentrations the ``All variables'' model selected the water quality
variables (turbidity, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total
phosphorus, and N:P ratios) as important variables (Downing et al.
2001). While there is variation in the response of chlorophyll \emph{a}
to changes in nutrient concentrations, the general pattern suggests that
limiting nutrients have predictable impacts. If we examine the partial
dependencies of these variables we see a general linear increase in log
chlorophyll \emph{a} with nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon
concentrations (Figure \ref{fig:all_partial_dependence}). This
relationship holds until nutrient concentrations become saturated. The
partial dependency plots (Figure \ref{fig:all_partial_dependence}) for
the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio is more complicated, indicating that for
ratios less than \textasciitilde{}14 chlorophyll \emph{a} increases but
after \textasciitilde{}14 there is marked decrease. The effect of the
nitrogen phosphorus ratio on chlorophyll has been the subject of
considerable research and our results are consistent with the majority
of the findings suggesting that at low ratio values nitrogen is limiting
(Downing and McCauley 1992, Smith and Schindler 2009). Conversely, at
higher ratios the phosphorus levels may be limiting. This would be a
cause for concern with linear models; however, linearity is not an
assumption of tree-based modelling approaches such as random forest.

Turbidity was selected as the most important variable in the ``All
variables'' model. The partial dependency analysis shows that, similar
to the nutrients discussed above, log chlorophyll \emph{a} increases
with increased turbidity. At first this may seem counter intuitive since
we might expect productivity to decrease as turbidity increases, and
therefore light availability decreases (Tilzer 1988, Bilotta and Brazier
2008). However, algal biomass can contribute heavily to measures of
turbidity and we expect greater productivity to lead to increased
turbidity (Hansson 1992). We interpret this pattern as indicating that
as chlorophyll \emph{a} concentrations increase we see a concomitant
increase in turbidity due to increased algal cell densities.

Elevation was selected as an important predictive variable in both the
all variables and the GIS only models; the partial dependencies (Figures
\ref{fig:all_partial_dependence} \& \ref{fig:gis_partial_dependence})
indicate a negative relationship between elevation and chlorophyll
\emph{a} concentration that is probably due to fact that the location of
mountains in the United States is the spatial inverse of the
distribution of agricultural and urban lands. As elevation increases we
expect decreased loads due to smaller watershed contributing areas. In
contrast lower elevation sites will have larger drainage areas and
greater potential for increased nutrient loads from urban and
agricultural sources.

The variables in the ``GIS only'' model captured the large scale spatial
pattern of the trophic status gradient of lakes across the United
States. In addition to elevation, mentioned above, the model was most
sensitive to latitude and ecoregion. In general, chlorophyll \emph{a}
concentrations are highest in the Southern portions of the study area
where temperatures can be higher (a known driver of productivity),
elevations lower, and agricultural impacts more pronounced. Likewise
ecoregion (see Figures \ref{fig:ecoregion_map} \&
\ref{fig:gis_partial_dependence}) has a pronounced affect indicting
continental scale effects of land use and geography. Agriculturally
dominated landscapes such as the Temperate Plains, Southern Plains, and
Coastal Plains show the highest levels of Chlorophyll \emph{a}. Whereas
high elevation zones (Western Mountains), arid lands (Xeric), Northern
habitats (Upper Midwest) have lower concentrations.

Further evidence for the role of land use/land cover variables, and
similar to results from Read et. al. (2015), is shown by the selection
of the percent cropland and percent evergreen forest variables. As
indicated by the partial dependency plots (Figure
\ref{fig:gis_partial_dependence}), chlorophyll \emph{a} increases with
cropland and decreases with evergreen cover. It is not surprising that
croplands were selected given the overwhelming impact of agriculture on
the eutrophication process. Evergreens and chlorophyll \emph{a}
concentrations show a negative association (Figure
\ref{fig:gis_partial_dependence}). As the percent of evergreens
increases we are likely to see increased elevation and soil differences
that limit agriculture.

Lastly, morphometry (e.g., depth) also proved to be important in the
prediction of lake trophic state (Genkai-Kato and Carpenter 2005). As
morphometry shows little to no broad scale spatial pattern and is unique
to a given lake, these data are likely illuminating the local, lake
scale drivers such as in-lake nutrient processing and residence time.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Our research goals were to explore the utility of a widely used data
mining algorithm, random forests, in the modelling of chlorophyll
\emph{a} and lake trophic state. Further, we hoped to examine the
utility of these models when built with only ubiquitous GIS data, which
allows estimation of trophic state for all lakes in the United States.
The ``All variables'' model had an RMSE of 0.09 and an adjusted
R\textsuperscript{2} of 0.8 whereas, the GIS only models had an RMSE of
0.22 and the adjusted R\textsuperscript{2} was 0.48. Our total accuracy
in predicting chlorophyll \emph{a} based trophic states was 69\% for the
``All variables'' model and 49\% for the ``GIS only'' model.

While the ``GIS only'' model showed lower prediction accuracies than the
``All variables'' model, the association between the uncertainty of
prediction and total accuracy (Figure \ref{fig:cond_prob_fig} and Tables
Tables \ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_all} \& \ref{tab:cond_prob_tab_gis})
suggest that the ``GIS only'' model will provide reasonable estimates of
trophic state for many lakes across the United States. Furthermore, we
can map the uncertainty of the predictions, thus, we know the spatial
patterns and location of the lakes for which we are certain, or not, of
their predicted trophic state. Given this and that these models may be
applied to any lake in the United States we can recommend using this
model.

Future iterations of this modelling effort may be able to utilize
modeled predictions of nutrients to improve accuracy and also maintain
broad applicability (Milstead et al. 2013). Changes such as these have
several advantages. First, this would allow for estimating changes to
chlorophyll \emph{a} and trophic state as a function of changing
nutrient loads, which are expected due to climate change (Adrian et al.
2009, Jeppesen et al. 2011, Moss et al. 2011, Jones and Brett 2014).
Second, with the ability to make predictions for most lakes in the
United States, the ``GIS only'' models could be used as a source of
information on national scale phenomena. For example, predictions of
chlorophyll \emph{a}, with measures of uncertainty, could be used in
efforts to scale up the contributions from lakes to broad scale
estimates of gross primary production.

For the ``All variables'' model, the \emph{in situ} water quality
variables drove the predictions. This is not surprising. For the ``GIS
only''" model, the results were more nuanced. Three broad categories
were routinely being selected as important: broad scale spatial patterns
in trophic state, land use/land cover controls of trophic state, and
local, lake-scale control driven by lake morphometry.

Our results raise three important considerations related to managing
eutrophication. First, the broad scale patterning, indicated by
ecoregion as an important variable, suggests regional trends. This is
noteworthy because it suggests that efforts to monitor, model and manage
eutrophication and cyanobacteria should be undertaken at both national
and regional levels. This corroborates past findings that regional
drivers are important for water quality (Cheruvelil et al. 2013).
Second, while direct control of water quality in lakes would have a
large impact, the land use/land cover drivers (i.e., non-point sources)
of water quality are also important, and better management of the
spatial distribution of important classes such as forest and agriculture
can provide some level of control on trophic state and amount of
cyanobacteria present. Third, in-lake processes (i.e., residence time,
nutrient cycling, etc.) are, as expected, important and need to be part
of any management strategy. Building on these efforts through updated
models, direct prediction of cyanobacteria, and additional information
on the regional differences will help us get a better handle on the
broad scale dynamics of productivity in lakes and the potential risk to
human health from cyanobacteria blooms.
